                Message-in-a-bottle is signaling without guarantee of delivery. When someone receives the message, it's interesting to see his reaction or opinion towards the message; this is a good way of starting a conversation between strangers. We build this android application to model this signal so that users can share and capture messages in environment with their phone.

                <h2>Problem statement</h2>
                To model message-in-a-bottle, we need to address three questions. First, How can we model the signalling using current technology? Second, What types of signals does this implementation promote? And third, How can we motivate the varied target audience - Gamers and explorers?

            <section id="approach">
                <h2>Approach</h2>
                We model the signal as <span class="highlight">a collection of locked spots</span>. Users have to unlocked spots to see the stories and images behind the clues. As a result, on <span class="highlight">spot creation</span>, the signaling is through clues, images, and stories. On spot uncovering, Signalling is through images, stories, and comment text. Because our approach utilizes geolocation a lot, it's better building on light devices.As a result, we decided to build an <span class="highlight"> Android app</span>. We implemented the app with <span class="highlight">Java, node.js, and MySQL database</span>. We will show our implementation with the snapshots.

                We have done a pilot study to see if our UI works as we intended for it to. We informed them of the purpose of the application as well as walked them through the different interface interactions. 
                We conducted spoke with 4 undergraduate students (2 CS, 1 Advertising, 1 General Engineering). 2 identified themselves as 'gamers' and the other 2 did not identify themselves as gamers, but do play mobile games such as Candy Crush Saga and Angry Birds casually.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                The users were quick to jump to suggestions, mentioning they would use the application if there were more 'motivation' to use it, such as a leaderboard or badges.
                Another user mentioned that he'd like for it to have a notifications feature, where a user would be informed when others found their spots.
                Other suggestions were primarily for improving the UI, such as adding button effects.
                They all enjoyed the idea of sharing places, but said they'd want for the clues to be more engaging (and spelling error free)
